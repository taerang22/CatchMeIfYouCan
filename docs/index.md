# Real-Time Ball Catching with a Kinova Gen3

## End Goal
The goal of this project is to catch a thrown ball in real time using a robotic manipulator,
by integrating perception, prediction, and control into a single closed-loop system.

## Why This Is Interesting
This project requires solving several challenging robotics problems:
real-time RGB-D perception, noisy state estimation, trajectory prediction under uncertainty,
and generating dynamically feasible motions within strict latency constraints.

## Real-World Applications
The techniques developed in this project are applicable to:
- Dynamic manipulation in industrial automation
- Human-robot interaction involving object handoff
- Robotic sports training and assistive robotics
- Interceptive manipulation tasks in unstructured environments
