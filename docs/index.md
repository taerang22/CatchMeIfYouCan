# Real-Time Ball Catching with a Kinova Gen3

## Introduction
This project aims to catch a thrown ball in real time using a Kinova Gen3 robotic manipulator.
The system integrates RGB-D perception, trajectory prediction, and model predictive control
to generate smooth and robust catching motions.

## System Overview
- **Perception**: RealSense RGB-D camera for 3D ball tracking
- **Prediction**: Estimate intersection point with a predefined catching plane
- **Control**: MPC + Jacobian-based inverse kinematics
