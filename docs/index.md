# Real-Time Ball Catching with a Kinova Gen3

This project demonstrates a real-time robotic system that catches a thrown ball
using RGB-D perception, trajectory prediction, and model predictive control (MPC).

## 🔍 Introduction

### End Goal
The goal of this project is to catch a fast-moving ball in real time using a robotic
manipulator, by tightly integrating perception, prediction, and control.

### Why This Is Interesting
This task requires solving several challenging robotics problems:
- Low-latency RGB-D perception
- Noisy state estimation and prediction
- Generating dynamically feasible motions under timing constraints

### Real-World Applications
- Dynamic manipulation in industrial automation  
- Human–robot object handoff  
- Assistive robotics and interceptive manipulation
